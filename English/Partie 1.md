NIS : 
The agency was officially established in 1961 as the **Korean Central Intelligence Agency**.
The National Intelligence Service in Korea is **responsible for overseeing national cybersecurity policy and defending against cyber threats.
The original duties of the KCIA were to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the military.
The NIS also investigates any cyber intrusions and conducts information analyses on cyber threats.
President Park’s government extensively used the intelligence service to suppress and disrupt anti-government or pro–[North Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") or other pro-communist movements, including the widespread student protests on university campuses and the activities of overseas Koreans.
In April 2014, the NIS was accused of fabricating false documents to accuse a North Korean of spying. A month later, the head of the NIS, Nam Jae-joon, resigned.

CIA :
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), founded in 1947 by the National Security Act, is one of the most well-known intelligence agencies in the United States. It is responsible for the acquisition of intelligence (notably by means of espionage) and most clandestine operations carried out outside the United States.
The CIA has two roles: on the one hand, it provides and analyses information on governments, companies and individuals from all over the world for the US government; and on the other hand, it conducts clandestine operations abroad. The latter, although often cited, would represent only about 3% of agency expend-in g.
